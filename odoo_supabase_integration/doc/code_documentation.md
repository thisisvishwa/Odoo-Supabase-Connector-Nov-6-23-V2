# Odoo-Supabase Advanced Integration Module Code Documentation

This document provides an overview of the code structure and key functions of the Odoo-Supabase Advanced Integration Module.

## odoo_supabase_model.py

This file contains the Odoo-Supabase Mapping Schema. It defines the mapping between Odoo models and Supabase tables, including complex relations and data type mappings.

## synchronization_service.py

This file implements the real-time synchronization engine using websockets or Supabase's real-time APIs. It also handles advanced conflict resolution strategies with manual intervention workflows.

## data_operations_service.py

This file supports batch operations and data streaming for efficient handling of large data sets. It also ensures data integrity across operations with transaction support.

## extensibility_service.py

This file builds an extensible framework within Odoo that allows other modules to plug into the Supabase integration layer. It also creates hooks and endpoints for extending functionality without modifying the core integration module.

## integration_architecture_service.py

This file implements a microservices architecture for handling data synchronization tasks, possibly using Odoo's `queue_job` module or external services like Celery. It also implements data caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve performance.

## security_service.py

This file uses encrypted channels for data synchronization. It also implements robust error handling and logging mechanisms to trace and rectify issues in data transactions.

## main_controller.py

This file coordinates the interaction between the services and the user interface. It uses the synchronization mechanism, data operations, and security design defined in the service files.

## test_odoo_supabase_integration.py

This file contains test functions for the functions defined in the other Python files. It is part of the Quality Assurance Plan.

## odoo_supabase.js

This file contains JavaScript code for interacting with the user interface. It uses the DOM Element IDs defined in `odoo_supabase_templates.xml`.

## odoo_supabase_templates.xml

This file defines the user interface elements that `odoo_supabase.js` interacts with.

## odoo_supabase_view.xml

This file defines the layout of the user interface in Odoo.

## __manifest__.py

This file lists the dependencies of the module, which are shared with all other Python files in the module.

## api_documentation.md

This document provides detailed information about the API functions defined in the service files and the main controller.

## user_manual.md

This document provides instructions for using the user interface defined in `odoo_supabase_view.xml` and `odoo_supabase_templates.xml`.
